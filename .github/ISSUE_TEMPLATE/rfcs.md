ALL BELOW FIELDS ARE REQUIRED

<h2 id="named-concepts">Named Concepts</h2>

*Explain any new concepts introduced in this request.*

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

*Explain in a Single paragraph what this request is about.*

<h2 id="reference-level-explanation">Reference-Level Explanation</h2>

*This section provides a detailed technical overview of the work. The design is explained with enough depth and detail to make it clear how:*

<em>

- The proposed changes interact with other systems (or other parts of the system that is changed)
- The actual implementation will take place
- Known challenges can be readily overcome

</em>

*This section includes practical examples and explain how this proposal makes those examples work.*

*This section becomes the engineering specification and work plan, so it must be sufficiently detailed to faciliate for that.*

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>


*Confirm that alternative approaches have been evaluated and explain those alternatives briefly.*

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>

<em>

- Why the currently proposed design was selected over alternatives?
- What would be the impact of going with one of the alternative approaches?
- Is the evaluation tentative, or is it recommended to use more time to evaluate different approaches?
</em>

<h2 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2>

*Describe any particular caveats and drawbacks that may arise from fulfilling this particular request?*

<h2 id="useful-rererences">Useful References</h2>

*Describe useful parallels and learnings from other requests, or work in previous projects.*

<em>
  
- What similar work have we already successfully completed?
- Is this something that have already been built by others?
- What other related learnings we have?
- Are there useful academic literature or other articles related with this topic? (provide links)
- Have we built a relevant prototype previously?
- Do we have a rough mock for the UI/UX?
- Do we have a schematic for the system?

</em>

<h2 id="unresolved-questions">Unresolved Questions</h2>

<em>

- What is there that is unresolved (and will be resolved as part of fulfilling this request)?
- Are there other requests with same or similar problems to solve?

- Which parts of the current system are affected by this request?
- What other open requests are closely related with this request?
- Does this request depend on fulfillment of any other request?
- Does any other request depend on the fulfillment of this request?*

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

*Describe the kind of testing procedures that are needed as part of fulfilling this request.*

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

*Describe the level of documentation fulfilling this request involves. Consider both end-user documentation and developer documentation.*

<h2 id="version-history">Version History</h2>

*History of changes to this RFC. Following semantic versioning pattern and v0.1.2 for style.*

<h2 id="recordings">Recordings</h2>

*Links to audio recordings of related discussion.*

## Work Phases
<h3 id="work-phases"></h3>

<h3 id="non-coding">Non-Coding</h3>
*Keep original naming and structure, and keep as first section in Work phases section*
  - [ ] Planning
  - [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Testing

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
